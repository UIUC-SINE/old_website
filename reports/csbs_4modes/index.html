<h4 id="bayesian-optimization">Bayesian Optimization</h4>
<p>The reconstruction parameters for the above section were all found using bayesian optimization, which is a common tool for searching hyperparameters.  Bayesian optimization is particularly well-suited to optimizing black box functions which are expensive to evaluate.  </p>
<p>In our case, the naive focus and naive grid methods both have a single \(\lambda_{tik}\) parameter for Tikhonov regularization, while CSBS grid and CSBS focus had both a Tikhonov \(\lambda_{tik}\) and a \(\lambda_{csbs}\) used during plane selection.  It's worth noting that for CSBS grid and CSBS focus \(\lambda_{tik}\) and \(\lambda_{csbs}\) should be the same, but we found that the reconstruction were much better when these were allowed to be optimized separately.</p>
<p>For posterity, the hyperparameter surfaces for each mode are included below.</p>
