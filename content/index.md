The past few years have been an interesting journey. If in 1000 years there would be a museum stature showing a digital native in his natural habit I am very certain a picture of me in my flat would fit. I am in possession of multiple computers, gaming consoles, a smartphone, and a tablet. Most of these devices are running at the same time. I recently caught myself "watching" a TV show. All good until now but at the same time I had my laptop open to some webpage on my lap and was currently fudging with an app on my phone. I would love to tell you what TV show I was watching but honestly, I can't. Neither do I remember what web page I was looking at nor what I was reading on my phone. When I am not writing on here I am also a student and as such rely on being able to concentrate for extended periods of time. And you know what? That is increasingly HARD. I recently did a little experiment I challenge everyone to repeat: Set a timer to 30 minutes and then start reading until the timer goes. If you can't resist the urge to look at the timer note down the time you think has passed and then look at it. For me, the result was disturbing. Only 13 minutes in it felt like at least 25 minutes must have passed. Multiple times I caught my thoughts wandering off to something else. Usually, this something else had something to do with either my phone, my tablet or my laptop and in all cases involved the internet.
